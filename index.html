       <p>Hi my name is Bob. I am a adult IT student at an IT!<br> Retraining for the digital world, hopefully I will be able to work on technical solutions to growing problems in the world. The courses I am taking are Web Internet and Design Principles, Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design, Networking Fundamentals and Database Concepts. <br>I am enjoying school very much and would like to use my break to work in the IT industry. I have a passion for the future of AI and have folowed alphaGo and other breakthroughs closely.<blockquote>"AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, the first to defeat a Go world champion, and is arguably the strongest Go player in history."</blockquote> From alphaGo's creators Deepminds website.</p>

           I got my start with being interested in computing by editing .ini files of games for quickfixes so I could play them. I also did trial and error by being an idiot and catching viruses then purging them by going into the H key registry to hunt them down. I am a strong believer in learning by doing, making mistakes and never repeating them. I look forward to your interest and working with you.
